	ABOUT THE PROJECT
	
	</p>
	
 <p>
 In 1705, Peter the Great ordered the court nobility as well as the rest of 
 the urban male population of Russia to shear their beards (with the exception
 for priests). It was one of his painful reforms which “cleaved the 
window to Europe”, according to the famous Pushkin line. Twenty two decades
 later, in 1917, the Soviet regime shut that window to the West again. For the two
 centuries in between, Europe has been extremely influential for Russian 
education, customs and lifestyles, and easily accessible for Russian travelers.
 It is interesting to examine the impact of one particular place - the excavation 
sites at Pompeii and Herculaneum - on the whole of Russian culture.
This project concentrates on recorded descriptions and impressions of Russian
 visitors to these sites in order to trace possible shifts in their perception and to
 recognize importance of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum for Russian
 culture. Archaeologists, courtiers, artists, poets and writers, diplomats,
 geographers - all were drawn to the Bay of Naples. Some were deeply in
 love with classical literature and with antiquities; others were more interested 
in ascending Vesuvius; and almost everyone wanted a souvenir dating back to 
AD 79.  The period to be studied covers almost two centuries -from the moment
 when the reforms of Peter the Great opened the borders of Russia for traveling 
and cultural exchange until the moment when October revolution of 1917
 and its consequences made the Russian intelligentsia escape
 in hurry.

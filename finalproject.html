 The Bay of Naples was a significant locus on the cultural map of the Russian Grand Tour. The practice of European travel with the purpose of “cultivating the heart”, “enriching the mind” and freeing oneself of “prejudices” started in Russia in the 1770s, a century later than in England, and lasted for at least seven decades. Voyages of the Russian elite led by private - not state - initiative became possible after the 1762 abolition of the compulsory twenty-five-year military or civilian service for nobles. 
 
  </p>
  
  <p>The idea of European travel was influenced and supported by the growing book market, which started providing much travel literature between the 1760s and the 1790s, including descriptions of journeys and of geography, history and art of different countries. Of those, the first travel guide to Herculaneum in Russian was published in 1789, and the first one to Pompeii only in 1843. For Russians, the lure of Pompeii and Herculaneum was part of the general fascination with Italy, its nature and its culture. The core of the greatness of the latter was often seen in the former. One of the travelers remarked that, living in Italy, you do not need to have much imagination, just record what you see around you: if Virgil had been strolling in the vicinities of St. Petersburg all his life and then would still be able to write the sixth book of Aenead, he would be twice the poet.

</p> 


 <p>Archaeologists, courtiers, artists, poets and writers, diplomats,
 geographers - all were drawn to the Bay of Naples. Some were deeply in
 love with classical literature and with antiquities; others were more interested 
in ascending Vesuvius; and almost everyone wanted a souvenir dating back to 
AD 79.  Admiration of the classical past, knowledge of
ancient Greek and/or Latin languages, as well as of classical literature and of Johann
Joachim Winckelmann’s writings were an integral part of the culture of the educated
Russian at the time. An enlightened Russian traveler perceived Italy as the cradle of all
European art, the birthplace of the Renaissance, and the guardian of classical antiquity.
How the exposed reality of Roman everyday life changed that idealized, perfected, whitemarble
myth of antiquity, and what responses it provoked is a promising topic for
exploration, but even a quick glance at epistolary reactions of the visitors to the site
reveal a sophisticated picture of its perception.

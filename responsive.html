	Portrait medals that emerged in the Renaissance revived the ancient Roman tradition and were the device to record and distribute someone's likeness, a device that carried the message of permanence and timelessness. In contrast with the ancient coins, Renaissance medals were not used as a currency but distributed among the people of important social circles, and among family and friends. These medals, with the rare exceptions, were produced in small amounts – five to ten medals at one casting.1 When one looks at the German Renaissance medals, the first thing that strikes the eye is that they are very different from the Italian ones. It is convenient to start with traditional dichotomy of Italian and northern art because the origins of the art form of Renaissance portrait medal are in Italy, and also because Italian medals are presented in the scholarly discourse as standard-setting in the medal enterprise. 
 	To be more specific on the issue of that difference, German medals display more diversity of the sitter's representation, and their style, in opposition to the Italian refinement and idealization, has been described as uncompromising, brutal realism.2 In addition, their reverses are usually either blank or display heraldic devices, in contrast with the intricate allegorical compositions practiced on the reverses of the Italian medals. These might be the main positions by which we judge the peculiarity of this art form on the German ground, and they deserve explanation and analysis.
	The various forms of representing a person on a medal are notable because the standard format on the Italian portrait medals, as on the ancient coins, is the profile view. Italian preference for profile, both in medallic and painterly portraits, has been discussed by scholars. On the other hand, the three-quarters view seems to be the format preferred in the Northern portraiture.3 German portrait medals undermine the authority of the profile format. They allow more freedom and very often represent sitter in three-quarters, and also in the frontal view. These portrait forms are much harder to sculpt and to produce, and this fact makes German predilection to them even more intriguing. 
In an attempt to evaluate the scale of that diversity, I have looked at the most complete catalogue of the German portrait medals of the sixteenth-century, compiled by Georg Habich and published in 1929-1934. It contains about 3,700 medals, and calculation of the illustrated on plates medals that were produced in the profile format versus those in other formats resulted in the approximate ratio 71% to 29%, respectively (fig.1).4 This diversity of the sitter representation, as well as different aesthetics in rendering the face, led traditional scholars to assess the quality of the German portrait medals as inferior to the Italian and explain German experimentation with the form by the lack of understanding of the classical heritage.5Likewise, the aesthetics of the early German medals is evaluated as superior to the later ones.6 But even those scholars who are biased toward the Italian medal note the merits of representational precision in rendering the features of the sitter, admitting that “the early portraiture in the sixteenth-century German medal forms a quite phenomenal European grouping, for no other school gave such extensive care and attention to the individual portrait image.7 It is interesting to turn from qualitative judgments which bear the imprint of our own aesthetic conventions to the reasons for the “brutal realism” of the German medals, as well as for representation of a sitter not only in profile, but also in three-quarters and in frontal view. By revising the traditional view, I am trying to show that the diversity and stylistic peculiarity of the German medals was not the result of inability of the German masters to reach the “high standards” set by the Italian and ancient precedents, but a response to complex socio-historical situation, and was shaped by various factors. The reasons for that representational diversity can be sought in the specifics of German humanism, traditions of local visual culture, effects of the Reformation movement on visual arts, particularities of German medal making, and patron's expectations in regard to the portrait. 
	The medium of the medal, because it has strong connotations of antiquity and classical learning, implies and even requires a profile format. Alexander Nagel and Christopher Wood, talking about the profile and the medals in relation to the sacred portrait of Christ in their work Anachronic Renaissance, say that the profile format and the durable material bear the connotations of antiquity and hence the implication of the true likeness of Christ.8. Wood in his other work says that “both the profile format and the replicable medium carried strong connotations of authenticity, proposing an authoritative set of features, not for a contemporary prince or merchant but for a holy man who had been dead for a millennium and a half.”9 Emphasizing the importance of the profile format, Wood goes beyond understanding of its reference to ancient Roman prototypes and suggests that it was a strategy to reduce the complexity of the face to a contour, apprehencible, more easily remembered linear form.10 If what Wood says is true, then why would German masters enhance the complexity of the face? What connotations did the durable material and the referential format carry for a contemporary prince or merchant? What was the significance and meaning of these medals, and how they were perceived? These are the questions which, as I try to answer them, will bring us closer to understanding the horizontal communication between the art forms of a particular era.11 The idea of horizontal communication is pronounced in the works of Amy Powell, Alexander Nagel, Christopher Wood and Maria Loh. In opposition to the vertical hierarchical communication, which sees preceding forms of art as originals and places them to a superior position, the idea of horizontal communication lies in considering the implication for the repetitiveness of art forms through the ages. Within this theoretical framework, artworks are seen as referential chains, where old models are “adapted and updated” by the artists who work “within a field of alternatives.”12</p>

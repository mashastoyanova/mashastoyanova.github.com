	The recent book "Pompeii in the Public Imagination from its Rediscovery to Today" (Oxford, 2011) has Karl Briullov’s
	 painting The Last Day of Pompeii as a frontispiece. </p>

	  Edited by Shelley Hales and Joanna Paul,
	  the book is a collection of essays, each of which explores Pompeiian heritage in its influence on the world culture,
	   from Goethe to modern tourists. Although the book doesn’t have a chapter on Briullov, the mere combination of the title 
	   and the picture on the cover makes one think about the grand success of painting back in 1833, when it was first exhibited
	    in the artist’s studio in Rome, and about the resonance it got. The glory of Karl Briullov (fig. 3) and of his canvas was
	     so grand that it forever shadowed the works on Pompeii by Alexander Briullov (fig. 4), an architect, and Karl’s older 
	     brother, who spent in Naples two years restoring the ruins and making dozens of drawings and watercolors. In 1829,
	      he published a book on Pompeian baths, and later used Pompeian motifs in his architectural work. 
	      It seems fair to examine contributions of both brothers to the construction of the modern image of Pompeii.

<p>We know much about the brothers’ life and work in Italy from their letters to family members and to the members of the 
Society. These were published in Briullov’s Archive in 1900 and serve as one of primary sources for the scholarship on the 
Briullovs. In May 1824, Alexander arrived at the Bay of Naples for the first time. Karl most probably first visited Naples only 
three years later: according to his letters, he didn’t leave Rome until the summer of 1827. Alexander seems to have enjoyed 
writing more than Karl, and his long letters contain detailed descriptions of his impressions, of the places he visits and of 
the activities he engages in. He writes to his parents in a letter dated May 8, 1824:
 <blockquote>
 
<p>Naples is so beautiful that if I wanted to describe it to you I would have to send you a whole book. … Having arrived 
in Naples, we rented a flat on the bayshore, that is, on the seashore; our windows are 
facing Vesuvius, the city is to the left, to the right is an open sea and the islands, and the constant noise, vividness and 
gaiety on the streets - this is our habitat. We spent the first days going sightseeing around the city, and, having satisfied 
somehow our curiosity, one morning we left the city to see its surroundings. Our first wish was to see Pompeii and Vesuvius;
 having passed Portici, Resina, Torre di Greco, Torre Annunciata, finally we saw some extensive hill, covered with recently 
 planted groves, and we were told that this was Pompeii. We were approaching, and the excavated part of this unfortunate city 
 came upon our view. </p>
				</blockquote>

<p>The next day, Alexander climbed Vesuvius in the company of other Russian travelers.  He recorded that trip in a group
 of ironic, caricature-like watercolors featuring the “Ascending Vesuvius” theme, now in the State Russian Museum </p>

<p>A German medalist stands closer to a “craftsman” rather than to an “artist”,
 and it is not known about the theoretical base that would assert the role of the medalist as an artist and tell 
 about his self-consciousness of him as such. This is a possible reason why not much is known of the German medalists: many 
 of them are identified as “monogrammist so-and-so” or “the master of the group.” The role of the artist in medal-making is a
  vast topic for future research, and the question of authorship in the medal-making is a complicated one. Production of a medal 
  was a process of artistic collaboration taking different forms. Before a medal was to be cast or struck, Konterfetter – a term 
  used in contemporary sources for a portraitist – was in charge for producing a model. Accounting records indicate that when
   Konterfetter cast the medal himself, he often ran into conflict with the regulations of the goldsmiths and silversmiths.1 
   Sometimes the medalist was only commissioned to to prepare the model, and the metalworkers did the casting.2 Hans Krafft, 
   for example, did not cast his medals, but he did the drawings and sculpting. A contemporary print by Nicolaus Weiler shows a
    self-portrait of the goldsmith and engraver active in the mid-sixteenth century (fig. 23). This self-portrait indicates growing
     self-consciousness of a craftsman/artist. Weiler includes the objects which he had produced and which bear his monogram, 
     and also his assistant. The inclusion of an assistant might have been intended to show that he is successful enough to have 
     one, but is also extremely important to the notion of authorship and telling of the collaborative nature of the medals 
     production. 
  The uniqueness or rarity of the object, so valued among collectors of all times, had the opposite meaning for the person
   commissioning the medal. The value of the medal portrait for a sixteenth-century patron was in its multiplicity and the 
   reproductive potential, and the same holds true for the portrait print. The original design and the unique model of the medal 
   were of less value than the medal itself, produced in quantities. However, if we think about the value of the medals from the
    collectors' perspective, the picture might be more complicated. Although the value of those medals for the collectors of the 
    time is a vast topic to be explored, it is hardly debatable that the crucial matter in collecting, now and five hundred years
     ago, is selection. On the modern art market, the criteria for the objects selection are mainly the same as the determinants
      of their value: authenticity, rarity, attribution, provenance, quality of execution and preservation, subject matter, size, 
      material costs. I have listed these factors in the decreasing order according to their significance in price fluctuation.
       For the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century collectors, however, this list would look quite differently. The concept of 
       authenticity in its modern sense has not yet emerged as such, and contemporary portrait medals were often stored and
        displayed together with ancient coins.3 Precious material of medal would often mean much more than the subject matter, 
        and that is part of the reason why only few of gold or silver medals survived till our days. Aside from monetary value,
         there was also aesthetic significance of the material for the sixteenth-century beholders. For example, the arrangement
          of objects in the cupboards of Northern Kunst- and Wunderkammern, as in some of Italian studioli was made on the basis 
          of material, and the cupboards were designed specifically for the harmonious display of gold, silver and bronze objects 
          in them.4 As Arne Flaten observes, “the medaglie that appear in Renaissance inventories were not commonly distinguished
           by specific type, artist, size, or subject, but if at all by material (i.e. lead, bronze, silver, gold).”5
For both the collector and the commissioner, two roles often represented in one and the same person, subject matter would in some
 
cases matter more than authorship. We can make some observations on the basis of the most frequently reproduced medals. As Habich's
 catalogue shows, most replicas were done after the medals representing personae of high reputation, as well as political and
  religious leaders. One of the most frequently reproduced medals is the medal representing Albrecht Dürer, designed by Dürer 
  himself and produced by Hans Krafft (fig. 24). At the same time, a medal representing Charles V, also by Dürer's design 
  (fig. 25), either has not been reproduced at all or, if it has been, it is not listed in the catalogues.
   This fact might tell us that the reasons for the popularity of certain medals among collectors of the earlier centuries 
   can be searched in their subject and aesthetic qualities more than in the authorship. However, with the growing importance 
   of the idea of an original author and an artist-genius, the name of the artist starts to matter more and more, and “during
   the “Dürer-Renaissance”, medals were made after Dürer's paintings, and from engravings after his drawings”6.
	To return to the shades of meaning of the different representational modes, the choice of the format tells us about
	 the patron's expectations. The three-quarters, the second popular after the profile format, adhering to the traditions of 
	 Northern portraiture, could be used and perceived as a format that connoted true lifelikeness. In the age before photography,
	  the purpose of the portrait was in recording a true likeness of the person, but the signifiers that would tell the audience 
	  about that verisimilitude could be different. Massys's medal of Erasmus, for example, has a Latin inscription “an image 
	  struck from the living model” on its obverse, a phrase which, as Silver points out, would guarantee an authentic likeness,
	   and which is echoed in Dürer's portrait of Erasmus of 1526.7  We can judge about the importance of attesting to the true
	    representation for the patron on the basis of Erasmus' letters who shows his disappointment with the Dürer's portrait
	     because of its poor likeness.8 Resemblance mattered no less for people of lower social strata, such as burgers, 
	     craftsmen, merchants, and it is possible that their truthful likeness, or the effect of such, might have been most
	      important in measuring the quality and value of the medal produced. In his will, which dates to the end of the sixteenth
	       century, Jamnitzer specifies that the children of his sister Ursula should “each receive a silver medal with his
	        likeness to remember him by.”9 The often-discussed German realism in rendering the sitter’s features, and great
	         attention to the surface details, would give the “reality effect” which, being a tool with the same purpose as the
	          inscription indicating that the portrait is credible because it had been done from a live sitter, would signify the
	           portrait’s authenticity. Realism in minute details represented verisimilitude as it was constructed in this local
	            visual culture. Nagel and Wood, speaking of devices that helped construct the authenticity of the portrait,
	             suggest that “the demand for authenticity was met by a combination of a high degree of particularity and an 
	             insistence on reliable replication.”10 This assumption seems to hold very true for German medals.
	To conclude, we have looked at the body of the German Renaissance portrait medals, the aesthetic particularity of which has 
	been shaped by diverse reasons, ranging from such factors as  specificity of the German humanism and ideas of the 
	Lutheran Reformation to the phenomenon of interweaving traditions. We have found that a medal representing sitter in
	 three-quarters or frontal view bears a connotation of permanence, but, unlike the profile medals which linked the sitter
	  to antiquity, refers to contemporary local paintings, sculpture and prints, and is within the local conventions of
	   portraiture which refuses to simplify form. We have also attempted to take the problem one step further, 
	   from the point largely concerned with the implications for production to the implications of perception, 
	   and suggested that drawing from local traditions might have carried connotations of authenticity for the portrait.
	    Throughout that mental exercise, the meaning of the art object proved to be constructed by its reference to the other
	     existing images, and its authenticity to be tied to the purpose of the object in a given era. It also showed the concepts
	      that art historians use as volatile and polysemous.</p>

<h2> KARL BRIULLOV </h2>
<p>

	The Briullo family had seven children: brothers Fedor, 
	Alexander, Karl, Ivan (died at the age of 20), Pavel (died in childhood)
	 and sisters Maria and Yulia. Their father, Pavel Ivanovich Briullo, was a 
	 descendant of French protestants Brulelau who fled to Germany and there changed 
	 their French last name onto German: Brullo, which in Russian was transformed into 
	 Брюлло, and is transliterated as Briullo. Pavel Briullo was a professor of ornamental 
	 arts at the St. Petersburg Royal Academy of Arts. Alexander Briullo was born in 1798, and Karl
	  a year later, in 1799. The brothers had been admitted to the Academy when they turned ten years,
	   Alexander in 1809 and Karl - in 1810. In 1822, the brothers graduated from the Academy with
	    honours. Upon graduation, and under the condition that an artist was not married, it was 
	    common then to send Russian artists for the internship abroad. In 1822, Academy sends both
	     brothers to Italy for three years, with an annual stipend of five thousand roubles provided
	      by the Society for the Encouragement of Artists, which was established in 1820. To get this
	       internship, however, an artist had to be a Russian, and that’s how Alexander and Karl had 
	       become the only family members of the Briullo family whose foreign last name was changed 
	       into the Russian one by adding “v” at the end.  In 1823, the brothers reached Rome. When 
	       they got there, they found there a whole colony of Russian artists, and a warm atmosphere
	        in the house of a Russian diplomat Grigory Gagarin, 
	under whose aegis they gathered along with other famous Russians. </p>

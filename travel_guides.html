<p>European and American visitors to the ancient sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum 
in the nineteenth century were fairly well informed about the attractions awaiting
 them and usually had certain expectations. They drew their knowledge from sources both fictional
  -- mostly poetry and prose featuring Pompeian themes-- and factual, descriptive essays on Pompeii 
  in the newspapers and magazines, and the guidebooks. The latter contained useful knowledge, often practical
   advice, and offered information that was up-to-date, complete, coherent and systematic whenever possible.
    A brief look cast on the vast number of the travel guides to Pompeii and Herculaneum from the eighteenth and 
    up to the first decades of the twentieth centuries will tell us that most of them offered an historical account
     on the region around the mount Vesuvius and of its destruction, descriptions and observations rich in detail,
      and contained references to the ancient sources and to contemporary scholars.

		<div class="accordionContent">Authors of these guides suggested 
      highlights of this must-stop on the Grand Tour and oftentimes projected their own attitudes and evaluations of
       Pompeian art, life and leisure. For modern scholars interested in the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, 
       these guidebooks are helpful documents in reconstruction of the development of scholarship on these ancient sites, 
       of the progress in accessibility of information to the public about the sites, and on the public perception of
        Pompeii. Just as Pausanias, one of the first known travel writers touring Greece in the second century AD,
         is an invaluable informant on the now lost objects of the Greek art, so the early guidebooks to the Bay of
          Naples are open vistas to the past visions of Pompeii. They also outline a wide variety of questions to be 
          answered. What do authors of these guidebooks suppose their readers should know about Pompeii? What sources 
          do they use, ancient and modern? Do they mention any objects that are now lost?
 How are the English, German, French, Italian and Russian guidebooks different from each other?</div>

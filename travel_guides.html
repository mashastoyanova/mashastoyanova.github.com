<div id="content">

<p>European and American visitors to the 
ancient sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the nineteenth century
 were fairly well informed about the attractions awaiting them and usually 
 had certain expectations. They drew their knowledge from sources both fictional - 
 mostly poetry and prose featuring Pompeian theme, and factual - descriptive essays on
  Pompeii in the newspapers and magazines, and the guidebooks. The latter contained useful
   knowledge, often practical advice, and offered information that was up-to-date, complete,
    coherent and systematic whenever possible. For modern scholars interested in the rediscovery
     of Pompeii and Herculaneum, these guidebooks are helpful documents in reconstruction of the
      development of scholarship on these ancient sites, of the progress in accessible to the public
       information about the sites, and on the public perception of Pompeii. Just as Pausanias, one
        of the first known travel writers touring Greece in the second century AD, is an invaluable 
        informant on the now lost objects of the Greek art, so the early guidebooks to the Bay of 
        Naples are open vistas to the past visions of Pompeii. They also outline a wide variety of 
        questions to be answered. What do authors of these guidebooks suppose their readers should 
        know about Pompeii? What sources do they use, ancient and modern? Do they mention any objects that
         are now lost? 
How are the English, German, French, Italian and Russian guidebooks different from each other? </p>

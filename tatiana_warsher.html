<p>TATIANA WARSHER </p>
<p></p>
	
	 
	<p> Tatiana Warsher was a Russian archaeologist who had to 
	flee Russia after the revolution. The significance of Tatiana Warsher’s works 
	on Pompeii is well known to Pompeian scholars. Her Codex Topographicum Pompeianus was 
	once called “the most extensive of all compilations of documentation on Pompeian painting 
	and architecture”# although it had never been published and is now stored in a few libraries 
	around the world. One copy resides in the photographic archive at the American Academy in Rome
	 and is described as the following: “The Warsher collection is composed by 18 albums of the Codex 
	 Topographicum Pompeianus, ca. 2000 silver gelatin prints (9x13 cm), in five boxes. There is also
	  a box containing the notes of the photographer. All the collection is about paintings and ruins
	   of Pompeii. The materials have not yet been inventoried. Everything is well preserved in boxes 
	   and the conservation project is in progress.”# However, one can request 
	images if needed. Another known copy is at the Getty Research Institute and counts 25 volumes.

	<p>THE WALKS OF A RUSSIAN IN POMPEII</p>
	
	<p><i>The Walks of a Russian in Pompeii </i>is a fruit of Levshin's two journeys to Italy, 
	in the timeframe from the early 1820s to mid-1830s. The book consists of six chapters, covering the 
	questions of the general history of Pompeii, its destruction and rediscovery, and offers the reader detailed
	 descriptions of Pompeii’s public buildings, private houses, cemetery (only one uncovered at that time)
	  and inscriptions uncovered by mid-1830s. 
	 The guide has a map of the city and about 20 illustrations, probably drawn by the author himself.
	  In the introduction, Levshin formulates his approach: 
	  <blockquote>“We do not promise lofty views, nor brilliant ideas, but we
	   are responsible for the thoroughness and accuracy of our description, drawn up on the spot, after two journeys 
	   from Russia to the shores of the Bay of Naples, and after many hours and days devoted to a detailed review of the
	    remnants of antiquity, and to comparison of our own observations with the views of well-known archaeologists.” </blockquote>
	    <p> The 
	    scope of information he offers to his readers, with retrospects into pre-Roman and Roman history of the region, Roman
	     customs and traditions, and overviews of the international scholars’ works on Pompeii published to date, and the site's
	      excavations, make his guidebook more a textbook on Pompeii rather than a tour book. The breadth of the topics covered 
	      in The Walks is impressing, but not uncommon for the guidebooks of the time.2 He is very personal and expressive when
	       he speaks. His narrative is rich in
	 evaluative adjectives, remarks and comments, as well as in flights of imagination, and thus
	  provides rich material for analysis. </p>

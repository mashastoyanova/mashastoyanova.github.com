<p>TATIANA WARSHER </p>
<p>1880 - 1960</p>
	
	 
	<p> Tatiana Warsher was a Russian archaeologist who had to 
	flee Russia after the revolution. The significance of Tatiana Warsher’s works 
	on Pompeii is well known to Pompeian scholars. Her <i>Codex Topographicum Pompeianus</i> was 
	once called “the most extensive of all compilations of documentation on Pompeian painting 
	and architecture” although it had never been published and is now stored in a few libraries 
	around the world. One copy resides in the photographic archive at the American Academy in Rome
	 and is described as the following: “The Warsher collection is composed by 18 albums of the Codex 
	 Topographicum Pompeianus, ca. 2000 silver gelatin prints (9x13 cm), in five boxes. There is also
	  a box containing the notes of the photographer. All the collection is about paintings and ruins
	   of Pompeii. The materials have not yet been inventoried. Everything is well preserved in boxes 
	   and the conservation project is in progress.”# However, one can request 
	images if needed. Another known copy is at the Getty Research Institute and counts 25 volumes.

	<p> POMPEII IN THREE HOURS (Rome, 1930) </p>
	<p>A typical tourist, now and then, usually spends on touring 
	the ruins 3 hours. Hot temperatures and fatigue make one want
	 to leave in about this much. It is vividly  described in Wilhelm
	  Jensen’s <i>Gradiva</i>:
Tatiana Warher knew that only too well. In the preface to her guidebook, she writes:
<blockquote>"...in most cases it is not the fault of the visitors that they cannot freely dispose their time. For after 
all whom do we meet at Pompeii? A big manufacturer from America who, not without searching of heart has left his business 
and who everyday receives cablegrams from his partner; a director of tramways in Japan, who has spent almost the whole of his leave 
journeying in Italy, but who is more than satisfied at having accomplished the dream of his youth; a school-teacher from New Zealand,
who had to spend a month crossing the ocean and who knows very well that this trip to Europe is the first and last 
in his life; an overseer of telephones in Norway: merchants and clerks of all nations, whose life consist much more 
in hard work than in pleasure: after having bent over their account books for years, they at last can allow 
themselves the luxury of a visit to Italy to see the beauties of nature and art, and of course, they must do it all in a hurry."
</blockquote>


The book has 100 illustrations and plans. It is interesting to look at her choice of building, 
the worthiest to be seen. These are: Temple of Apollo, Basilica, Forum, Temple of Vespasian, 
Temple of Jupiter. Macellum, Temple of Fortuna, Forum Baths, House of Pansa, Herculaneum Gate, Street of 
Tombs, Villa of Diomedes, Villa of Mysteries, House of Sallustius, Mercury Street, House of the Faun, 
House of the LAbyrinth, House of the Vettii, House of the Golden Cupids, House of the Silver 
Wedding, House of Lucretius Fronto, House of Obelius Firmus, House of the Centenary,  Stabian Baths. </p>

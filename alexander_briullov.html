<h2> ALEXANDER BRIULLOV </h2>

	 <p>
	 
The glory of Karl Briullov and of his canvas was
so grand that it forever shadowed the works on Pompeii by Alexander Briullov,
 an architect, and Karl’s older 
brother, who spent in Naples two years restoring the ruins and making dozens of drawings and watercolors. In 1829,
 he published a book on Pompeian baths, and later used Pompeian motifs in his architectural work. 
	It seems fair to examine contributions of both brothers to the construction of the modern image of Pompeii.
</p>

<p>We know much about the brothers’ life and work in Italy from their letters to family members and to the members of the 
Society. These were published in Briullov’s Archive in 1900 and serve as one of primary sources for the scholarship on the 
Briullovs. </p>


<p>three years later: according to his letters, he didn’t leave Rome until the summer of 1827. Alexander seems to have enjoyed 
writing more than Karl, and his long letters contain detailed descriptions of his impressions, of the places he visits and of 
the activities he engages in. He writes to his parents in a letter dated May 8, 1824: </p>
 <blockquote>
 
<p>"Naples is so beautiful that if I wanted to describe it to you I would have to send you a whole book. … Having arrived 
in Naples, we rented a flat on the bayshore, that is, on the seashore; our windows are 
facing Vesuvius, the city is to the left, to the right is an open sea and the islands, and the constant noise, vividness and 
gaiety on the streets - this is our habitat. We spent the first days going sightseeing around the city, and, having satisfied 
somehow our curiosity, one morning we left the city to see its surroundings. Our first wish was to see Pompeii and Vesuvius;
 having passed Portici, Resina, Torre di Greco, Torre Annunciata, finally we saw some extensive hill, covered with recently 
 planted groves, and we were told that this was Pompeii. We were approaching, and the excavated part of this unfortunate city 
 came upon our view." </p>
				</blockquote>

<p>The next day, Alexander climbed Vesuvius in the company of other Russian travelers. 
 He recorded that trip in a group
 of ironic, caricature-like watercolors featuring the “Ascending Vesuvius” theme, 
 now in the State Russian Museum. </p>

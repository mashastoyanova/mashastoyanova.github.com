<h1>Tepidarium</h1>

<p>
The artistic connection between the two architects germinated during their sojourn on the Bay of Naples around mid-1820s. A trip to Italy was the ending point of Zahn’s and Briullov’s study at their respective academies – the Art Academy in Kassel, and the St. Petersburg Royal Academy for the Arts. While in Pompeii, both Briullov and Zahn chose to record, among other spaces, the tepidarium (warm chamber) of the Forum Baths – one of the best-preserved rooms at the time.
<br> </br>
Produced nearly at the same time , their views of the tepidarium are among the first recordings of this particular architectural space. The prints are very similar, although Zahn’s was done with the help of the camera lucida, and Briullov’s, most likely, in the traditional way. Briullov’s image of the tepidarium appeared in his architectural study of the Forum Baths, entitled Thermes de Pompèi, published in Paris in 1829 by Firmin Didot. 
Zahn’s illustration of the same space comes from the 1832 edition of William Gell’s “pocket companion and guide to those who visit the spot,”  Pompeiana: The Topography, Edifices and Ornaments of Pompeii, the Result of the Excavations since 1819 (London, 1832).

<br></br>
The textual context of the illustrations sheds some light on the major goals that the artists pursued in their recordings of the tepidarium. Zahn’s image appeared in the immensely popular and influential publication. William Gell saw meticulous documentation as a major goal of his publications, and identified Zahn as a “friend”, “an artist of merit”, and “an indefatigable and exact artist.” Gell promptly indicated that in production of the image of the tepidarium, Zahn relied on the camera lucida. By doing so, Gell claimed to provide the most truthful representation of the past, which became possible through the technological achievements of the present. Zahn’s image, in accordance with Gell’s dedication to the most accurate and detailed description of the Baths, was meant to provide a veritable archaeological depiction of the space.

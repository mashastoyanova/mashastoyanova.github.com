<h2> </h2>
<p>ALEXEY LEVSHIN </p>
<p>1799-1879</p>
	
	
	
<h2> </h2> 
	<p>  A prominent Russian statesman, one of the theoreticians of the reform for the abolition of serfdom 
	in Russia and one of the founders of Russian Geographical Society. The author of many valuable scholarly works,
	 he worked in the Asian Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he got noticed for his brilliant
	  education and genuine devotion to his work. He was also a member of Parisian Asian Society and Parisian Geographical 
	  Society, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Science. 
	Later in his career he became a mayor of Odessa. History, ethnography and geography have always been his primary interests.
	</p>
	
	<p>THE WALKS OF A RUSSIAN IN POMPEII</p>
	
	<p><i>The Walks of a Russian in Pompeii </i>is a fruit of Levshin's two journeys to Italy, 
	in the timeframe from the early 1820s to mid-1830s. The book consists of six chapters, covering the 
	questions of the general history of Pompeii, its destruction and rediscovery, and offers the reader detailed
	 descriptions of Pompeii’s public buildings, private houses, cemetery (only one uncovered at that time)
	  and inscriptions uncovered by mid-1830s. 
	 The guide has a map of the city and about 20 illustrations, probably drawn by the author himself.
	  In the introduction, Levshin formulates his approach: 
	  <blockquote>“We do not promise lofty views, nor brilliant ideas, but we
	   are responsible for the thoroughness and accuracy of our description, drawn up on the spot, after two journeys 
	   from Russia to the shores of the Bay of Naples, and after many hours and days devoted to a detailed review of the
	    remnants of antiquity, and to comparison of our own observations with the views of well-known archaeologists.” </blockquote>
	    <p> The 
	    scope of information he offers to his readers, with retrospects into pre-Roman and Roman history of the region, Roman
	     customs and traditions, and overviews of the international scholars’ works on Pompeii published to date, and the site's
	      excavations, make his guidebook more a textbook on Pompeii rather than a tour book. The breadth of the topics covered 
	      in The Walks is impressing, but not uncommon for the guidebooks of the time.2 He is very personal and expressive when
	       he speaks. His narrative is rich in
	 evaluative adjectives, remarks and comments, as well as in flights of imagination, and thus
	  provides rich material for analysis. </p>

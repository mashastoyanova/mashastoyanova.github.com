<h1>Alexander Briullov and Wilhelm Zahn: Artistic Encounters Around Pompeii</h1>
</header>



<div class="content">
<p>
The architects Alexander Briullov and Wilhelm Zahn are prominent figures in the nineteenth-century architectural history, particularly in its segment that explores European appropriation of the classical artistic heritage rediscovered on the Bay of Naples. </p>

Their responses to the Pompeian legacy range from accurate archaeological documentation to artistic imitation, and reveal interconnections between the two architects. 
For each of them, a visit to Pompeii in the early 1820s was the event that determined their future lives and careers, gave them respected positions in their profession, and important commissions.

 Briullov is considered one of the main artistic figures who brought a fashion for the Pompeian style into Russian homes.   He used Pompeian motifs in his designs of many interiors, from the royal residences to the apartment buildings he was renting out.  
 
 Zahn is known best not for the architectural commissions, but for his three-volume compilation of Pompeian and Herculanean decorations, recorded and lithographed in colour by the author: <a href="http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/zahn1828ga"><i> Die schönsten Ornamente und merkwürdigsten Gemälde aus Pompeji, Herkulanum and Stabiæ</i> (1828-1852).</a> The book was widely known and served as an a-la carte menu of Pompeian and Herculanean ornaments for architects imitating and re-creating Pompeian interiors during the era of Romanticism.
 
  <br></br> The story of indirect interaction between Briullov and Zahn is yet another thread in the fabric of the rediscovery narrative, one that extends beyond the usual locales discussed in the Anglo-American scholarship. Although we do not know if Briullov and Zahn ever met, their virtual relationship illustrates that the rediscovery of Herculaneum and Pompeii led to creation of the universal visual vocabulary that was shared by artists in both Western and Eastern Europe. 
</p>

<p>
The artistic connection between the two architects germinated during their sojourn on the Bay of Naples around mid-1820s. A trip to Italy was the ending point of Zahn’s and Briullov’s study at their respective academies – the Art Academy in Kassel, and the St. Petersburg Royal Academy for the Arts. While in Pompeii, both Briullov and Zahn chose to record, among other spaces, the tepidarium (warm chamber) of the Forum Baths – one of the best-preserved rooms at the time.
